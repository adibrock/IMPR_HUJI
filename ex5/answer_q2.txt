How to use the workflow implemented to train a network to estimate the high-res counterpart
of a low-res image:


The corruption function will be to take the original image, reduce it and then expand the 
reduced image back to it's original size (using the expand and reduce functions from ex3).

In order to estimate the high-res counterpart of a given image we will follow the next steps:

If we want to enlarge the given image and estimate the high-resolution enlarged image we
will expand the given image before using restore_image, than give the expanded image to the
restore_image function that will estimate the high-resolution enlarged image using the trained
network.

If we want to simply take an image an sharpen the quality (we want the high-res counterpart to 
be a high-res image of the same size as the original image), we will simply give it to 
restore_image that will predict the high-res image usong the trained network.
