For the denoising task, with a singal residual block I did not get a very good restored image,
and with 3 blocks I got a much better image. With 5 residual blocks the restored image 
did not seem as good as the one i got with 3 blocks. As can be seen in the graph I got, the more
residual blocks the model had (from 1 to 3) the less val_loss I got. But when the number of
blocks was increased to 4 and 5 I got a larger loss than with 3 blocks.

For the deblurring task, the more residual blocks the model had, the better the output was.
with 1 residual block the restored image was not very clear, but the more residual blocks I 
used in the model the closer the restored image was to the original image. Also, in the graph 
for the deblurring task, the more residual blocks the model had, the lower val_loss was
- meaning the output was better.
