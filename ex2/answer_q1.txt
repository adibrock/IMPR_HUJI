When using convolution or fourier to calculate the magnitude images, we get two different 
magnitude images because when we use convolution to derive, we only use an approximation to the 
derivatives with epsilon = 1: lim(epsilon --> 0) (f(i,j) - f(i-epsilon, j))/epsilon
while when using the fourier transformation to calculte the derivative we calculate the exact 
derivative and  dont lose any information.
