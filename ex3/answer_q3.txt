When the blending of 2 images is performed with a varying number of 
pyramid levels,  the blending quality changes. 
The more levels we have in the pyramid, the better the blending is. 
When reconstructing the blended image from  the merged Laplacian pyramid, 
we blend the merged image every level of the reconstruction. 
Therefore, the more levels we have in the pyramids, the more we blend 
the two images together, and the edges (where the two images 
were joined) look better combined.
